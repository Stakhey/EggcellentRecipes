    <p>It's Fry-day, and you're eggs-hausted. Maybe your friend was egg-noring you, or someone played a few too many practical yolks on you, or maybe you even messed up on your eggs-am. You may have even put all your eggs in the wrong basket and lost a bet with your mates. You need something or someone to crack you up, like a comedy-hen or some good food. That's it! Food is always the answer! </p>
    <p>Who doesn't love some delicious eggs for breakfast, or a tasty Spaghetti Carbonara dish at lunch? Who would refuse downright salivary deserts such as souffle, or nice snacks like cookies? And hard boiled eggs are just so hard to beat. With myriads of choices to eggs-plore, this website has got you covered with some of the finest egg recipes around. Love 'em or hate 'em, eggs are here to stay and have been farmed by people for millennia. In the UK, it is estimated that 13.5 billion eggs are eaten every year, averaging out to 37.1 million a day! Those are some eggs-traordinary numbers, and what's more, eggs are eggs-tremely healthy. The average egg contains 6g of quality protein, and many different minerals and vitamins that are vital for humans, such as vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin B5, vitamin B12, vitamin E, selenium, calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, manganese and many more. They have relatively low calories, so paired with eggs-ercise can help you achieve your weight loss goals. So what are you waiting for? Let's get cracking, and have an eggs-tra good day!</p>
